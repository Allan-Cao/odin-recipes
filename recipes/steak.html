    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Here is my steak recipe. I almost always reverse sear my steaks since it the most consistant way to cook steaks that I know of. (barring sous-vide but that's too hard)</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Steak! It can literally be any cut, cheap or expensive.
        </li>
        <li>
            Salt
        </li>
        <li>
            Pepper
        </li>
        <li>
            Any oil works; I usually use Olive Oil
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat your oven to 200 F or 95 C.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the oven is preheating, season your steak with salt and pepper. Rub with oil and oil a baking dish or wire rack, either works.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake the steak until it has an internal temperature of 125 F or 50 C for Medium Rare. Lookup the other doneness temperatures if you <em>really</em> don't want a perfect steak.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat when the steak is close to being finished. If you don't have a cast iron skillet any non-stick pan will work as well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn the heat down to Medium and sear the steak 2-3 minutes on the first side until a nice sear is achieved, flip and sear 1-2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Take the steak off the heat and place it on a plate to rest for 5 minutes. Please don't touch the steak at this time, trust your thermometer it will be cooked perfectly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Enjoy! Remember to slice <strong>against</strong> the grain to ensure the softest bites!
